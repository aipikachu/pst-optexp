1.1  2007-09-06   * Considerably enhanced labeling of the components.
                    Added new parameter 'labelref' which specifies the
		    reference coordinate system for the label positioning
		    and the rotation of the label. Default is labelref=relgrav,
		    the label point is rotated together with the component, but
		    the label text itself is not rotated.

		  * parameter labelrelative is now obsolete, and replaced by 
		    labelref=relative. It will be removed in future versions.

		  * parameter polwidth, bswidth, iwidth and owidth are now obsolete, 
		    and replaced by polsize, bssize, innerheight and outerheight for 
		    consistency reasons. They will be removed in future versions.

		  * macro \polarisation was changed to \polarization for consistency. 
		    The old notation is obsolete and will be removed in future versions.

                  * fixed bug: filling of all components with 'fillstyle'
                    is now possible.

                  * added some liftpen=1 in the code to fix the look of 
		    the lenses and the optgrid.
